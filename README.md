## TypeScript HTTP Client for faster development and testing

Offstage is a HTTP request library, with a focus on **mocking** and **testing**.

You define your mock data **once**, Offstage then allows you to:

- Click through your app without a backend
- Playwright test the production build
- Verify backend compatibility by auto generating Pact files

## Breaking
- From now on defaults to network mode

# Highlights

- 🚀 Easily define a **TypeScript Request API**
- ⚡️ **Mock data** for development (stripped out of production build)
- 🎭 **Same** mock data for Playwright (to test the production build)
- 🦄 **Override** mock data (for testing specific scenarios)
- 🤝 Automatic **Pact** tests (to verify compatability) (experimental)
- 🔥 **Small** footprint (adds less than 5kb to your production build)
