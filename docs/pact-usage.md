# Pact usage

Offstage can automatically generate Pact contracts based on the mock data you have already provided! ðŸŽ‰

Pact facilitates contract testing. This allows you to ensure compatability without end-to-end tests. From https://docs.pact.io :
> Pact is a code-first tool for testing HTTP and message integrations using contract tests. Contract tests assert that inter-application messages conform to a shared understanding that is documented in a contract. Without contract testing, the only way to ensure that applications will work correctly together is by using expensive and brittle integration tests.


# Step by step
This section assumes you already have Offstage working nicely with Playwright. If not, please follow [Playwright usage](playwright-usage.md) first.

## 1. Provide a configuration

In the root of your project, create a `offstage.config.ts` file to configure the following Pact settings:

- `consumerName` the consumer name of the contract, for example 'MyApp'
- `providerNames` Mapping of service names to provider names.
```ts
// offstage.config.ts
export default {
  pact: {
    consumerName: 'MyApp',
    providerNames: {
      exampleService: 'ExampleService',
    },
  }
}

```

## 2. Provide 'testInfo' in mount() calls

Providing the Playwright `testInfo` object allows us to use the test name in Pact contracts:

```ts
// tests/example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { mount } from 'offstage';

test.beforeEach(async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
  await mount(page, testInfo);
});
```

## 3. Generate Pact contracts

With the configuration in place:
- run `npx playwright test`
- run `npx offstage pact`

To automatically publish to a Pact broker, supply the following environment to `npx offstage pact`:

- `OFFSTAGE_PACT_BROKER_URL`: url of Pact broker
- `OFFSTAGE_PACT_BROKER_USERNAME`: username for publishing
- `OFFSTAGE_PACT_BROKER_PASSWORD`: password for publishing
- `OFFSTAGE_PACT_COMMIT`: current git commit sha
- `OFFSTAGE_PACT_BRANCH`: current git branch
